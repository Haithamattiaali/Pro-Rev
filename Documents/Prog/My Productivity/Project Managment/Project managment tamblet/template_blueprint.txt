PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEMPLATE BLUEPRINT
=====================================

VISION: Create an intelligent project management template that goes beyond simple task counting to provide accurate progress tracking through impact-based algorithms and parent-child relationships.

KEY OBJECTIVES:
1. Replace count-based progress tracking with impact-based scoring
2. Enable bottom-up progress calculation from child tasks
3. Consider task dependencies and parallelism
4. Provide intuitive, focused user experience
5. Generate reliable one-page status reports

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
==================

CORE COLUMNS:
1. Task ID - Unique identifier
2. Task Name - Clear description
3. Task Type - Parent/Child indicator
4. Parent Task ID - Links child to parent
5. Task Duration (Days) - Estimated time
6. Start Date - Planned start
7. End Date - Planned end
8. Actual Start - Real start date
9. Actual End - Real completion date
10. % Complete - Current progress
11. Task Agility - Parallel/Sequential
12. Dependencies - Linked task IDs
13. Dependency Type - FS/SS/FF/SF
14. Impact Score - Calculated value (0-100)
15. Criticality Level - High/Medium/Low
16. Resource Assignment - Team/Person
17. Status - Not Started/In Progress/Complete/Delayed/Blocked
18. Health Indicator - Green/Yellow/Red
19. Notes - Additional context

IMPACT SCORE ALGORITHM COMPONENTS:
=================================

1. BASE IMPACT FACTORS:
   - Duration Weight (DW): Longer tasks = higher impact
   - Dependency Count (DC): More dependencies = higher impact
   - Resource Criticality (RC): Critical resources = higher impact
   - Timeline Position (TP): Earlier tasks = higher impact

2. MULTIPLIERS:
   - Blocking Factor (BF): Tasks blocking others get multiplied impact
   - Parallel Reduction (PR): Parallel tasks share impact weight
   - Delay Amplification (DA): Delayed tasks increase impact

3. FORMULA:
   Impact Score = (DW × 0.25 + DC × 0.30 + RC × 0.20 + TP × 0.25) × BF × PR × DA

PARENT-CHILD PROGRESS CALCULATION:
==================================

1. CHILD PROGRESS AGGREGATION:
   - Weighted by Impact Score
   - Formula: Parent Progress = Σ(Child Progress × Child Impact) / Σ(Child Impact)

2. ROLLUP RULES:
   - Health Status: Worst child status propagates up
   - Delays: Maximum child delay affects parent
   - Dependencies: Parent inherits all child dependencies

VISUAL DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:
============================

1. COLOR SCHEME:
   - Primary: #9e1f63 (Authority/Headers)
   - Secondary: #721548 (Section dividers)
   - Accent Blue: #005b8c (Trust/Progress)
   - Accent Coral: #e05e3d (Action items)
   - Status Green: #2ecc71 (On track)
   - Status Yellow: #f1c40f (At risk)
   - Status Red: #e74c3c (Critical)

2. TYPOGRAPHY:
   - Headers: Verdana 14px Bold
   - Sub-headers: Verdana 12px Bold
   - Body: Verdana 10px Regular
   - Impact Scores: Verdana 11px Bold

3. LAYOUT ZONES:
