PROJECT SYNC-UP DASHBOARD BLUEPRINT
=====================================

VISION: Create an intuitive yet comprehensive dashboard that enables instant project understanding while maintaining depth for those who need details.

CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. Information Hierarchy - Most critical info visible immediately
2. Progressive Disclosure - Details available on demand
3. Visual Clarity - Use space, color, and size meaningfully
4. Actionable Insights - Every element drives decisions
5. Real-time Relevance - Focus on "what matters now"
