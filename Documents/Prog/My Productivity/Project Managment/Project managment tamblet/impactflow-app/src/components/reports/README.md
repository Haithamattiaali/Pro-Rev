4. Customize the loaded template as needed

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **React Components**: Built with TypeScript and React hooks
- **State Management**: Uses Zustand for project data
- **Charting**: Chart.js for standard charts, D3.js for complex visualizations
- **Layout**: react-grid-layout for drag-and-drop functionality
- **Export**: html2canvas for screenshots, jsPDF for PDF generation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for consistent design

### Widget Interface

Each widget implements a common interface:
```typescript
interface WidgetProps {
  widget: ReportWidget
  onUpdate: (updates: Partial<ReportWidget>) => void
  isEditing: boolean
}
```

### Data Flow

1. Widgets pull data from the project store
2. Data is processed and aggregated within each widget
3. Visualizations update automatically when project data changes
4. Widget configurations are stored in the report state

## Customization

### Adding New Widgets

1. Create a new widget component in `src/components/reports/widgets/`
2. Add the widget type to the `WidgetType` enum
3. Update the widget library with the new widget metadata
4. Add the widget case to the ReportBuilder's render switch

### Styling

- All widgets follow the project's design system
- Colors and spacing use Tailwind utility classes
- Charts use consistent color schemes defined in each widget

## Performance Considerations

- Large datasets are aggregated before rendering
- Chart updates are debounced to prevent excessive re-renders
- D3 visualizations use efficient update patterns
- Export operations show loading states for better UX

## Future Enhancements

- Save reports to backend
- Share reports with team members
- Schedule automated report generation
- Add more widget types (Gantt charts, custom metrics)
- Implement data filters at the report level
- Add real-time collaboration features
