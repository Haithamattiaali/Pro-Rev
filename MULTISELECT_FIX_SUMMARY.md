# Multi-Select Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue
The multi-select functionality wasn't working when multiple quarters were selected. Data aggregation wasn't happening, and the dashboard was still showing data for only one quarter.

## Root Cause
The issue was in multiple places:

1. **FilterContext** wasn't properly handling the `selectedPeriods` field from HierarchicalFilterContext
2. **Overview, BusinessUnits, and Customers pages** weren't passing multi-select parameters to the API
3. **API Service** had incorrect conditions for when to use multi-select endpoints

## Solution Applied

### 1. FilterContext Fix
Updated `handlePeriodChange` in FilterContext to accept and store `selectedPeriods`:
```javascript
// Added 'selectedPeriods' to the condition
if ('selectedMonths' in filterConfig || 'selectedQuarters' in filterConfig || 'selectedYears' in filterConfig || 'selectedPeriods' in filterConfig) {
```

### 2. Dashboard Pages Fix
Added multi-select parameter preparation to Overview, BusinessUnits, and Customers pages:
```javascript
// Prepare multi-select parameters if in multi-select mode
const multiSelectParams = periodFilter.multiSelectMode ? {
  years: periodFilter.selectedYears || [periodFilter.year],
  periods: periodFilter.selectedPeriods || [],
  viewMode: periodFilter.viewMode || 'quarterly'
} : null;
```

### 3. API Service Fix
Changed the condition to use multi-select endpoint whenever periods are selected:
```javascript
// Before: if (multiSelectParams && (multiSelectParams.years?.length > 1 || multiSelectParams.periods?.length > 1))
// After: if (multiSelectParams && multiSelectParams.periods?.length > 0)
```

## Data Flow After Fix

1. **HierarchicalFilter** → User selects multiple quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3)
2. **FilterSystemWrapper** → Passes `selectedPeriods: ['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3']` to FilterContext
3. **FilterContext** → Stores the selectedPeriods in periodFilter state
4. **Dashboard Pages** → Create multiSelectParams with periods array
5. **API Service** → Detects periods.length > 0 and uses multi-select endpoint
6. **Backend** → Aggregates data for all selected quarters
7. **UI** → Displays combined data for all selected periods

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Click the multi-select toggle in the filter bar
2. Select multiple quarters (e.g., Q1, Q2, Q3)
3. The dashboard should now show aggregated data for all selected quarters
4. Check console logs for confirmation of multi-select API calls

## Backend Verification
The backend multi-select endpoints are working correctly as verified by direct API call:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/overview/multi-select \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"years":[2025],"periods":["Q1","Q2","Q3"],"viewMode":"quarterly"}'
```

This returns properly aggregated data for the selected quarters.
