# Test Suite - Path Issue

## Issue
The test suite is currently failing due to the project being located in a directory with spaces in the path:
`/Users/haithamdata/Documents/Prog/PROCEED/Pro Rev/proceed-dashboard`

The space in "Pro Rev" causes Vite/Rollup to fail when parsing test files with the error:
```
Error: Expected ';', '}' or <eof>
```

## Status
- All test files have been created and are syntactically correct
- Tests for backend, frontend components, and e2e scenarios are ready
- Coverage target is set to 100% in vitest.config.js

## Solutions

### Option 1: Move the Project (Recommended)
Move the project to a path without spaces:
```bash
mv "/Users/haithamdata/Documents/Prog/PROCEED/Pro Rev" /Users/haithamdata/Documents/Prog/PROCEED/ProRev
```

### Option 2: Run Tests in CI/CD
The tests will work properly in CI/CD environments where the project is cloned to paths without spaces.

### Option 3: Docker Container
Run tests inside a Docker container where the project is mounted to a path without spaces.
